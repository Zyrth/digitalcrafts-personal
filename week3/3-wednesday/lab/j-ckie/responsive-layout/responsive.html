            <p>Hi, I'm Jackie!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm a 25 year-old Californian native currently living in Houston, Texas. Before moving here six years ago, I was a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara where I majored in Art Studio. After moving, I studied Game Art and Design at the Art Institute of Houston.</p>

            <span class="strikethrough"><p>Don't tell my parents this, but I probably should've followed their advice when they told me to get into engineering...</p></span>
            <br>
            <p>I've dabbled with web design on a very basic level for quite some time (thank you Neopets!) and a good majority of what I know now is all thanks to the incredible free resources available online!</p>
            <br>
            <p>If there's one thing I've learned it's that Google is your best friend when learning any skill.</p>

            <br>
            <p>I am currently the Digital Media Manager for a small office furniture company where I manage everything from our marketing materials to the company website. I also wear the hats of Help Desk extraordinaire and office furniture consultant so if y'all need any comfy chair suggestions, feel free to ask!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Previously, I was the Procurement Systems Administrator for KIPP Houston dba KIPP Texas where I worked with Jaggaer (previously known as SciQuest) to develop, implement, and maintain KIPP Houston's new procurement system - KIPPeMart.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After the KIPP Texas merger, I was responsible for maintaining and training approximately 3000 user accounts statewide as well as working closely with the Finance department to improve procurement workflow and integration with the company's ERP (Intacct).</p>
            <br>
            <p>It was a pretty tough job, but I am forever grateful for the memories and experience I accumulated during my time with the company!</p>
