    <h1>Basic Rules:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</li>
        <li>Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.</li>
        <li>Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.</li>
        <li>To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.</li>
        <li>If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.</li>
        <li>If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.</li>
    </ul>
